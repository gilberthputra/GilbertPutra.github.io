							<h1>NYC YELLOW TAXI</h1>
							<h2>Predicting Tip Amount Based on Hourly Weather Forecast</h2>

							<p>NOTE : Above picture is taken from and courtesy of <a href = "https://inhabitat.com/mit-says-3000-ride-sharing-cars-could-replace-all-new-york-city-taxis/">inhabitat.com</a>.</p>
							<p>
								This <b>Project</b> ultimately aims to develop <b>Penalised Regression Model</b> 
								for which it has the capacity to predict <b>Tip Amount</b> based on widely 
								available hourly weather forecast to help Yellow Taxi Cab Drivers. Furthermore, 2018 Yellow Taxi (YTX) data taken 
								from Taxi and Limousine Committee (TLC) and Global Hourly Climate (GHC) data from 
								National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) will be analysed. From there,
								the model will be trained, validated and be utilised to predict 2019 with further 
								critical analysis on its performance. With that said, the model performs approximately
								<b>0.3071</b> for <b>R-squared</b>, <b>1.007</b> for <b>MAE</b> and <b>3.171</b> for <b>MSE</b> when predicting 2019 data.
							</p>
							<p>
								Below are the following tasks:
								<ol>
									<li> <b>Extract</b> 2018 and 2019 Yellow Taxi Data from 
										<a href = "https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page">New York City Taxi
											 & Limousine Commitee (NYC TLC)</a> page.</li>
									<li> <b>Extract</b> Hourly Weather Data from 
										<a href = "https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-hourly/archive/csv/">National Centers 
											for Environmental Information (NCEI)</a> page.</li>
									<li> Cleaned and Preprocessed <b>103 Million Instances</b> 
										of NYC TLC Yellow Taxi by utilising <b>PySpark Architecture</b>.</li>
									<li> Cleaned, Preprocessed and Combined NCEI Hourly Weather
										 with the preprocessed NYC TLC Yellow Taxi dataset by utilising <b>PySpark Architecture</b>.</li>
									<li> Perform a Preliminary Analysis (GeoSpatial and Features 
										Analysis) on the combined dataset.</li>
									<li> Perform Statistical Modelling.</li>
								</ol>
							</p>
							<p>
								In summary based on the results found from <b>2018</b>, <b>Taxi Drivers</b> 
								are suggested to pickup from <b>La Guardia Airport</b> between <b>17:00 and 19:00</b> 
								as passengers generally Tip more than other areas regardless of the weather. As 
								<b>Tip Amount</b> shows little to no less correlation to weather forecasting. Moreover, 
								the amount of weather data may be insufficient incomparison with NYC TLC Yellow Taxi data as 
								weather was taken from the average of every hour reducing the amount of data. However, the 
								weather data utilised were also taking measurement/reading every 15 minutes which might still be lacking
								as there is significant data imbalance. Despite this, <b>Ridge Regression</b> performs comparably moderate 
								dealing with this problem although it could still be improved by adding more relevant features or increasing
								weather readings.

								NOTE : RESULTS AND DISCOVERY ARE LIMITED BY THE CAPACITY OF MY OWN DEVICE 
								(SHOULD LEARN HOW TO USE CLOUD, MY DEVICE COULDN'T KEEP UP). IF OPPORTUNITY RISES, SHOULD 
								TRY TO INCREASE WEATHER READINGS AS IT TAKES SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MEMORY.
